# Testing and Implementing Random Forest Algorithm for Breast Cancer Prediction

Using a public breast cancer dataset from University of Wisconsin Hospital, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg, this project is aimed to test the efficiency of Random Forest Algorithm on the dataset to see whether it is a good fit to predict and classify breast cancer malignancy. I omitted several data rows whose data points are missing in order to make the algorithm runs without unrecognizable error. This project was written in Google Colab Notebook environment and can be run directly through the link directed there. I used Python and its libraries--NumPy, scikit-learn, and pandas--to set up the machine learning algorithm.

## Result
The accuracy score is approximately 0.956 (95.6%). While this is a good thing, the downside of this algorithm is that it can fall into the problem of overfitting. Therefore, improvements and optimizations are needed in order to keep the balance between underfitting and overfitting.
